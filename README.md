2D Video Game repository
========================
Hey guys here is a repository on github for us to collaborate on our project with.

## For Our Artist and Music Provider
Send the music and art to Daniel or David and we will put them onto this repository.

## For the Code Monkeys on Our team
I would recommend a full overview of github.
Understanding pushing and pulling, as well as the need for someone to review your code before pushing the changes.
Also understand and using forks, andbranches, merging them so we don't currupt our current project or delete something we don't want to.
